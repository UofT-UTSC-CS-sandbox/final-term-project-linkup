# LinkUp: Transforming Resume Reviews into Opportunities!

## Overview

LinkUp is a dynamic web application designed to transform how job seekers refine their resumes and expand their professional networks. By enabling users to anonymously upload and review resumes, LinkUp creates a collaborative environment focused on delivering constructive feedback. This interactive platform uses a swipe-based system for document review, where users swipe right to engage and provide feedback, and swipe left to skip, ensuring thorough evaluation of each resume.

When mutual right swipes occur, signaling a match, LinkUp allows users to initiate direct messaging, fostering deeper connections and potential professional collaborations. This system not only enhances resume quality through direct community feedback but also builds a network of professionals who can support each otherâ€™s career growth. LinkUp is committed to helping job seekers improve their employment prospects in a competitive market while nurturing a supportive professional community.

## Motivation

The job market is fiercely competitive, and a standout resume is crucial for success. Many job seekers lack access to tailored feedback that could elevate their resumes from good to great. Our platform addresses this by enabling users to anonymously receive and provide detailed feedback, facilitating a more effective resume refinement process in a supportive community environment.

## Contribution

We appreciate contributions to LinkUp and value your efforts in enhancing the application. Here are the guidelines for contributing:

### Git Flow Strategy

We will employ the Git Flow strategy, which utilizes a two-branch system, *main* and *develop*, to manage the project's codebase. The *main* branch will contain stable releases, while *develop* will hold all completed features.

New features should branch from *develop*, and upon completion, a Pull Request (PR) should merge back into *develop*.

#### Branch Naming and Commit Guidelines

We will categorize branches as feature, bugfix, hotfix, or chore. Commits should follow the Conventional Commits structure to simplify change tracking.

#### Testing and Documentation

Ensure thorough testing of new features to maintain stability. Documentation should be updated accordingly.

### Issue Tracking

We utilize GitHub Issues to manage bugs, feature requests, and other tasks. Check existing issues or create a new one before starting your work.

### Pull Requests

After completing your changes, submit a pull request to the *develop* branch. A team member will review and provide feedback before merging.

We believe in the power of collaboration to build the best product possible and look forward to your contributions to make Linkup better.
