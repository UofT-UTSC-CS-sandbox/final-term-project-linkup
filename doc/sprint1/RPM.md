# LinkUp - Release Planning Meeting
The release planning meeting was held on May 31, 2024 at 4:00 p.m. through Discord. Every member of our group attended the meeting.

## Release Goals
The primary goal of the release is to create a web interface that allows users to develop and improve their resumes through community-driven feedback and professional networking. Our platform allows users to upload their resumes anonymously and interact with other users, ranging from industry professionals to job recruiters to job-seeking students. Through a swiping mechanism, users can swipe right to give feedback and connect professionally, or swipe left to skip. Mutual right swipes result in a match, allowing both users to engage in direct messaging for deeper reviews and networking opportunities. Through our platform, users have the ability to upload multiple resume documents, customize their settings and preferences to decide the kind of people they want to interact with, explore trending resumes, leave comments and reviews on public resumes, and direct message other users that they matched with. 

## Scope

Users should be able to sign up so that they can create an account and log in so that they can access their existing account. (LC-10) After signing up, users should get an anonymous username so that their privacy is protected (LC-22). After the registration process, users can upload multiple resumes so that other users can view them (LC-20). They can also delete the resumes that they add, so that they can add different versions or updated resumes (LC-21). The name and personal information on the resume should be hidden to maintain anonymity (LC-23). The user has the ability to decide and set their preferences so that they can customize their experience to what they are looking for (LC-11). This can be edited at any time when using the app (LC-32). The user also has a personal profile page that they can customize whenever they need to (LC-37).

Once the user starts swiping, the user can swipe left to reject or swipe right to match with the people that they want to connect with (LC-24). Users can view the comments left on their resumes from a user swiping right on them (LC-29). They can also leave comments on resumes that they swipe right on (LC-28). Any hateful comments will be filtered and removed (LC-33). They can zoom into resumes to view the content more clearly (LC-26). Once two users match with each other, they can start a private one-to-one chat with each other to network (LC-25). These chats can also be deleted once a conversation is done, to clean up your chat history (LC-30). Users can also block each other to prevent further interactions (LC-36).

The user can also view trending resumes if set to public in order to see what types of resumes are getting the most traction (LC-27). Comments can be left on these resumes in order to give your feedback on the document (LC-31). You can also reply to other's comments in order to interact and see other's views on trending resumes (LC-34). Users can upvote or downvote these comments to influence what comments are at the top and most relevant for these trending resumes (LC-35).
