# User Stories

## Sprint 1

1. **As a new/registered user, I want to sign up and log in so that I can create an account and access my existing account.**

    Given a user is on the sign-up page, when they enter their email and password and click "Sign Up," then an account should be created and a confirmation email should be sent. Given a registered user is on the login page, when they enter their credentials and click "Log In," then they should be logged into their account.

2. **As a new user, when I create an account, I want to be able to set my preferences in the types of documents that I can view from other users so that I can customize my swiping experience.**

    Given a new user is creating an account, when they reach the preferences step, then they should be able to select the field of interest, experience level, education level, geographic location from the drop down menu.

3. **As a registered user, I want to upload more than one resume so that I can choose what document I want other users to view.**

    Given a registered user is on the upload page, when they select and upload multiple resumes in .png, .pdf, or .docx formats, then they can view the uploaded resumes in the ‘My Resumes’ section on their profile page.

4. **As a registered user, I want to be able to delete as many of my uploaded documents so that I can upload other documents to replace them.**

    Given a registered user is on their profile page under the ‘My Resumes’ section, when they click the "Delete/trash bin” icon at the bottom right of their resume, then the document should be deleted after a confirmation prompt.

5. **As a registered user, I want an anonymous username so that my privacy is protected.**

    Given a new user is signing up, when they complete the registration process, then the system should automatically assign an anonymous username, and they should be able to locate their generated username in the Profile page.

## Sprint 2

1. **As a registered user, I want my name and contact information on my resume to remain confidential in public view so that my anonymity is ensured.**

    Given a registered user uploads a resume, when the resume is displayed publicly, then any personal information (name and contact details) should be automatically blurred out.

2. **As a user, I want to swipe left (reject) or right (wanting to match) on resumes so that I can personalize my resume browsing experience and choose what accounts I want to match with. After matching, I want to continue swiping without needing to leave a comment or start a private conversation.**

    Given that a user is currently on the main page, when they swipe right (accept)/ left (reject) on a document, then the user should be notified with a swiping animation that the resume they swiped on is a match or not a match, and when the user matches they should be able to continue swiping without needing to leave a comment or start a private conversation.

3. **As a user who has matched with another user, I want to be able to start a private one-on-one conversation with that user so that I can network with them and gain a professional connection with them.**

    Given a registered user has matched with another user, when the matched user clicks on a button to “start a conversation”, then the registered user should be led to the “Conversation” page where they can send direct messages to the user they have matched with. 

4. **As a registered user, I want to be able to zoom in on documents so that I can view the content on the document more clearly.**

    Given a registered user is viewing a resume, when they click on the resume, then the user should be led to a page where the document is zoomed in and can scroll the page to view all the content on the resume.

5. **As a registered user, I can view trending documents so that I can see what types of documents are getting the most traction on the platform.**

    Given a registered user is on the “Trending Resumes” page, when they browse the gallery of the most viewed resumes, then they should see a view of the resume(s), the number of impressions each resume had, and a comment section corresponding to each resume.

## Sprint 3

1. **As a user, I want to be able to leave comments on the document of the user that I have swiped right on.**

    Given that a registered user has swiped right on the document of another user, when they click a button to leave a comment, then they should be directed to a view where they leave comments on sections of the document. Once they have finished leaving comments, then they can press the “ESC” key to leave the view. 

2. **As a registered user, I can view comments from users I have matched with or swiped right on me.**

    Given a registered user is viewing their document, when they check for comments, then they should be able to view comments left on their document by other users, one user at a time, so that they can efficiently review feedback provided by each user without their screen being cluttered.

3. **As a registered user, I want to delete conversations with users that I have matched with so that I can manage my chat history.**

    Given a registered user is in their chat history, when they select a conversation and click "Delete" from the dropdown menu of the three-dot icon, then the conversation should be removed from their chat history.

4. **As a registered user, I can write and publish public comments on trending documents so that I can leave feedback on documents that I may not have seen.**

    Given a registered user is viewing a trending document, when they click on a button “Leave  Comment” then the user can write a message in a text box and click “Submit,” and the comment should appear publicly on that document’s comments section.

5. **As a registered user, I want to be able to edit my preferences so that I can modify my swiping experience whenever.**

    Given a registered user is in their profile settings, when they edit their preferences (the field of interest, experience level, education level, geographic location), then the resumes displayed in their feed should be updated accordingly.

## Sprint 4

1. **As a registered user, I do not want to see hateful and discriminatory comments that users may have left on my document.**

    Given a registered user views comments on their document, when another user has left a hateful or discriminatory comment on their documents, then they should not be able to see those comments.

2. **As a registered user, I can reply to public comments on trending documents so that I can interact with different users and get to know their thoughts on the trending documents.**

    Given a registered user is viewing comments on a trending document, when they have clicked “Reply” to another user’s comment, then they can write a message and click “Submit,” and the reply should be posted and visible under the original comment.

3. **As a registered user, I can upvote and downvote public comments on trending documents so that I can influence what comments are seen at the top of the public comment section(s).**

    Given a registered user is viewing comments on a trending document, when they click on the up/down arrow mark next to a comment, then the vote should be registered and the comment's position should adjust based on its score.

4. **As a registered user, I can block users that I have matched with so that I can prevent users from talking to me.**

    Given a registered user is in a matched conversation, when they click on the “Block User” button in the “three-dot” menu, then the blocked user should no longer be able to send messages, vice versa.

5. **As a registered user, I can customize my profile so that I can personalize my account.**

    Given a registered user is on their profile settings page, when they change their profile icon (choosing from the options provided) or profile bio, then the changes should be saved and reflected on their public profile.
